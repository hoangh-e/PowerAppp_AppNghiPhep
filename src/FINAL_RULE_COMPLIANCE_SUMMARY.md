### 2. Fixed DesignSystemComponent.yaml ✅

#### Violations Fixed:
```yaml
# ❌ BEFORE (5 violations)
Text: =Concatenate(

    "Secondary: RGBA(99, 102, 241, 1);"
  )

# ✅ AFTER (0 violations)  
Text: |
  =Concatenate(
    "Primary: RGBA(59, 130, 246, 1);",
    "Secondary: RGBA(99, 102, 241, 1);"
  )
```

#### Specific Fixes Applied:
1. **DesignSystem.Constants** - Added pipe operator for multi-line Concatenate
2. **DesignSystem.Typography** - Added pipe operator for 280+ char formula
3. **DesignSystem.Spacing** - Added pipe operator for 350+ char formula

- ✅ **Long OnSelect formulas** without pipe operator (>120 chars)  
- ✅ **Concatenate functions** without pipe operator
- ✅ **Multi-line formulas** without proper syntax

### 3. Script Output Example ✅
```bash
🔍 POWER APP FORMULA COMPLIANCE CHECKER
=======================================

Checking: src/Components/DesignSystemComponent.yaml
✅ No violations

Checking: src/Screens/LoginScreen.yaml
❌ Long OnSelect formula without pipe operator (458 chars)

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1) ⚠️
**HIGH PRIORITY FILES** (7+ violations):
1. **ApprovalScreen.yaml** - 7 violations
2. **LeaveConfirmationScreen.yaml** - 6 violations
3. **AttachmentScreen.yaml** - 6 violations

**ACTION**: Apply pipe operator to all long formulas

### Phase 2: Medium Priority (Week 2) 📝
